Thomas:

* All the jsp files are under WebContent folder as well as js and css files.
* All the java files are under src folder, there are three packages, default one is useless, just class example, the support package contains helper function to read all information about countries, major, universities, from the text file given by the professor, you can check out the support.jsp file first, it is under WebContent, is a example file showed how to use those helper function provided by support.java
* then you can work on your address.jsp page, You can browse my code and find your spot and finish the implementation, and try to make sure that chooseLocation.jsp page can responde correctly to your location choice, you can modify the chooseLocation.jsp page, now I only print out all the states and nations without processing your page's input parameter.
